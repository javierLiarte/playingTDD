Capital gains

get rid of SavingsAccountYear initializers

clean up _SavingsAccountYearTest

Fix primitive obsession

Consider what to do about withdrawing more than the starting balance -- assert that this is impossible
fix SavingsAccountYear.newAccount abstraction -- use it or dont?
We're passing in capitalGainsTaxRate everywhere -- put it in constructor?
eliminate totalWithdrawnExceptCapitalGains()? -- not interesting
