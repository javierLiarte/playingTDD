Capital gains

get rid of SavingsAccountYear initializers

clean up _SavingsAccountYearTest

Fix primitive obsession
Make sure next year is setting all variables properly -- need to carry forward capital gains, for example
Calculate endingCapitalGains()

Consider what to do about withdrawing more than the starting balance -- assert that this is impossible
fix SavingsAccountYear.newAccount abstraction -- use it or dont?
We're passing in capitalGainsTaxRate everywhere -- put it in constructor?
